There are various functionalities you can add to your GitHub bot to enhance its capabilities. Here are some ideas:

1. Fetch Repository Information: Allow users to provide a repository name or URL, and retrieve details such as the number of stars, forks, open issues, and contributors.

2. Create Issues: Enable users to create GitHub issues directly from the Telegram bot. Users can specify the repository, issue title, description, labels, and assignees.

3. Manage Pull Requests: Implement functionality to list open pull requests for a repository, provide details about specific pull requests, and even merge or close pull requests based on user commands.

4. Get Commit History: Allow users to retrieve the commit history of a repository, including the commit messages, authors, and timestamps.

5. Code Search: Implement a code search functionality where users can provide a search query, and the bot searches for code snippets or specific files in the repository.

6. Repository Notifications: Notify users about new commits, pull requests, issues, or other activities related to repositories they subscribe to. Users can choose to receive notifications for specific events.

7. Code Analysis: Integrate code analysis tools like ESLint or Prettier and allow users to trigger code analysis on specific files or the entire repository. The bot can provide reports or suggestions for code improvements.

8. Issue and Pull Request Labels: Allow users to manage labels for issues and pull requests. Users can create, update, or delete labels through the bot.

9. Repository Collaboration: Implement features to manage repository collaborators. Users can add or remove collaborators, view the list of existing collaborators, and manage their permissions.

10. Continuous Integration/Deployment: Integrate with CI/CD platforms like Travis CI or Jenkins. Users can trigger builds, deployments, or tests for their repositories through the bot.

These are just a few ideas to get you started. You can choose functionalities that align with your project goals and the specific needs of your target users. It's important to design the bot's functionalities in a user-friendly and intuitive manner to provide a seamless experience for users interacting with GitHub through Telegram.
